# Machine and Room Management System

## Overview

This project is a Java-based machine and room management system developed using Java Swing for the graphical user interface and RMI (Remote Method Invocation) for client-server communication. The system allows users to manage machines and rooms within a facility, making it ideal for organizations looking to streamline resource allocation and tracking.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The system provides a user-friendly interface created using Java Swing, making it easy to interact with and navigate.

- **Client-Server Architecture**: The project follows a client-server architecture with the server responsible for managing data and serving client requests.

- **Room Management**: Users can create, edit, and delete rooms, each with its properties like room name...

- **Machine Management**: The system allows for the addition and removal of machines within rooms, with details such as machine name...

- **RMI Communication**: The project leverages RMI to facilitate communication between the client and server, ensuring data consistency and secure transactions.
